Database
========

The database of plugins is held in our `PluggerDB <https://github.com/LizardByte/PluggerDB>`_ repository. The majority
of plugin metadata is pulled using GitHub's API, but categories are added manually. To add plugins, or update
categories for a plugin, you can open an issue on PluggerDB. Please follow the instructions in the PluggerDB
readme.
